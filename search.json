    "text": "Hard work: We are often working on cutting-edge research. This means that there is no clear path to success. We will have to try different things, and we will fail often. This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community."

This course includes both lectures and recordings, covering essential ML concepts, practical implementation, and research methodologies that form the foundation for our lab’s work.\nGit and GitHub: There are a ton of good resorces on Git and Github. I’m linking two such resources here:\n\nYouTube video by Kevin Stratvert\nGithub skills\n\nPython Data Science Stack:\n\nWe recommend students to study the Python for Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python: RealPython has a nice tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming in Python. We recommend students to go through the tutorial. They also have a corresponding video page.\nLaTeX: We typically use LaTeX for writing reports and papers. We recommend students to use Overleaf for students to get started. Overleaf has a nice 30 minute tutorial that covers the basics of LaTeX. We highly recommend students to go through the tutorial.\nCreating a Website and Blog: We highly recommend students create a simple website and a blog. We have been happily using Quarto for our website and blog. You may see in action in Nipun’s website and corresponding GitHub repo here; and Nipun’s blog and corresponding Github repo here.\nBoth of these are built via Github actions. Feel free to reuse these for creating your own website and blog. We will be happy to help you get started."

    "text": "Expectations\nHard work: We are often working on cutting-edge research. This means that there is no clear path to success. We will have to try different things, and we will fail often. This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community."

    "text": "Expectations\nHard work: We are often working on cutting-edge research. This means that there is no clear path to success. We will have to try different things, and we will fail often. This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community."

    "text": "Communicating Research\n\nWriting Papers\nPaper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\nPaper structure and Abstract: I gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\nLaTeXify figures: We’d suggest using this latexification tool to make the matplotlib figures publication-ready. It helps in the following aspects:\n\nIt helps in setting the exact size of the figure relative to the column width or page width of the paper. After using this tool, manually setting the size within the \\begin{figure} block is rarely needed.\nWe can set the font size relative to the text font size in the paper to ensure fonts are not too small or too big.\nIt converts the fonts into latex fonts so that the fonts in the figures do not look different from the main text font.\n\n\nTip: You can find page width and column width with \\the\\textwidth and \\the\\columnwidth commands, respectively.\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\nTables: We follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\nComments in LaTeX: We typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\nAmerican v/s British English: There are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\nGrammarly and other AI tools: I recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences.\n\n\nPoster\nIn some venues, the main presentation format is a poster. Posters are a great way to present your work in a visual format, and to have one-on-one conversations with people who are interested in your work.\nOne common mistake people make while making posters is to try to cram in too much information. Remember that the poster is to supplement you and not to replace you.\nPlease see below for two posters that we have made in the past.\n\nSample Poster 1\n\n\n\n\nSample Poster 2\n\n\nPlease find the presentation files corresponding to the first poster 1. Apple Keynote\n\nMS Powerpoint\nGoogle Slides\n\nLaTeX users can use the following templates on Overleaf to make their posters."

It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python: RealPython has a nice tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming in Python. We recommend students to go through the tutorial. They also have a corresponding video page.\nLaTeX: We typically use LaTeX for writing reports and papers. We recommend students to use Overleaf for students to get started. Overleaf has a nice 30 minute tutorial that covers the basics of LaTeX. We highly recommend students to go through the tutorial.\nCreating a Website and Blog: We highly recommend students create a simple website and a blog. We have been happily using Quarto for our website and blog. You may see in action in Nipun’s website and corresponding GitHub repo here; and Nipun’s blog and corresponding Github repo here.\nBoth of these are built via Github actions.

    "text": "Sometimes, the detours are the best part of the journey!\nIt was the third year of my undergrad, I was looking for a Foreign Academic Summer Internship in Machine Learning or Computer Vision. I was having a hard time finding an internship. It was the same time I had enrolled myself in Prof. Batra’s Machine Learning (ML) Course. Believe me, he is the best when it comes to teaching. It was the first time in my undergraduate studies when I felt like going to a class 😊. And it was his teachings that made me knock on the doors of the Sustainability Lab. I first met Prof. Batra and asked him if he could help me get an internship. I had no thoughts then on a summer internship under him, and the rest is history. I was very disappointed about not getting a foreign research internship, and even though he didn’t know me, he was all willing to help me out. I had finally found a mentor in him. From the very same semester, I started working with the Lab and then onwards there was no looking back. And now whenever I think about my BTech, this lab was a big part of it. \nI have worked on 4 different projects and some open-source contributions for one and a half years. When the entire world was going crazy behind deep neural networks, it was under him that I explored the probabilistic machine learning models. And got a whole new perspective on ML. My first-ever project was on Deep Gaussian Processes for Air Quality Inference, though this was a course project, it never felt that way. There was continuous guidance from him and his PhD Zeel B Patel. Though we had limited time we were able to make significant contributions. We as undergrads (other collaborators Eshan Gujarathi, Saagar Parikh, and Sachin Yadav)  were able to publish our work as an extended abstract at ACM India, 6th Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data CODS-COMAD 2023. I also had the privilege of presenting this work at the conference, and to our surprise, we were the only undergrads who had published their work. We recently got one citation, hurray my H-Index is now 1 😊."

In my third-year summer internship, I had the opportunity to work on Batched Gaussian Processes. It was this solo research that gave me a lot of confidence in myself and though it was difficult to understand the math behind GPs, Prof. Batra and other labmates were always there to help me out. Prof. Batra is extremely reachable, you just have to ask him and he will instantly set up a meeting and will explain everything with great passion every time. I just used to wonder at times, how passionate a person can be. The thing about this lab is that you don’t feel like you are working for the first time, so welcoming is the atmosphere. I still cherish the AB6 Workspace where we as a lab used to spend the entire day, have fun, and help each other. His feedback during research meetings might feel harsh at times but yes that always motivated me to work to the best of my potential. One of the best parts of working with this Lab is that Prof. Batra knows what our future goals are and accordingly assigns projects to students considering his/her interests. I still remember that he knew I was applying for a master’s and he put me on an application-based project and pushed me to publish a paper in AAAI or NeurIPS. Until then I had never even dreamt of such a publication. \nAnd guess what I was successful in publishing my work on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) using Bayesian deep learning strategies like Gaussian Processes in the NeurIPS workshop on Gaussian Processes in 2023 (collaborator: Gautam Vashishtha). A lot of credit goes to Prof. Batra and PhD Zeel. It was my experience of GPs from the summer that helped me quickly get going with this tough problem. And this work of mine has to be the highlight of my BTech. This work not only molded me into a good researcher but also taught me numerous life lessons. Prof. Batra’s dedication in academia as well as in day-to-day life always motivated me to do better each day. Every time I used to go with some updates on the work done, he would always point out even the minutest details, you might feel does it even matter. But believe me, it does, this makes you perfect at what you do, not only in research! I learned how to write good papers, and how to do productive research. “Drawing conclusions or insights is the key to any research problem” - were always the words of Prof. Nipun Batra!\nThis project had lots of ups and downs but he always pushed me whenever I felt low and felt like the project was not heading anywhere. But you have to trust Prof. Batra and follow his advice especially when you feel everything is going down the spiral. Prof. Batra’s words still echo in my ears, never run behind publications, and don’t think much about the end goal. Just focus on your current work, set smaller milestones, and keep producing results and you will never know when you will have a flurry of publications. Isn’t this relevant to anything you do in life, just focus on the present! My last work with this lab was on Multi Output models for air quality inference. Every new project feels like a new challenge but when you have an excellent mentor and support in the lab the job is half done. By the beginning of this project, I started enjoying research. To touch on another aspect, I had never realized the importance of open-source contributions unless I joined this Lab. The excellent environment at the lab of always helping ML society, helped me make contributions to Dr. Kevin Murphy’s (Google Researcher) Book."

It had been a couple of years since I had been self-exploring electronics and IoT-related projects and participating in online forums like Element 14 community and making various projects. One of my projects was ThingFinder, which I got incubated at GUSEC as a student-startup, without even fully understanding what a startup meant. This was probably one of the pivotal points, as it opened a plethora of opportunities in front of me, being part of the startup network in Gujarat, not just limited to grants and startup network, but also support from facilities like Nasscom at IIT Gandhinagar.\nIt was one of the events by IBM at Nasscom, IITGn, that someone suggested to me given my curiosity to learn and work on projects, I should reach out to Professors at IIT Gandhinagar and potentially work with them to learn and grow further. This led me to then look up Professors at IIT Gandhinagar who worked on Projects on similar lines to my interest and cold-mailed them with long paragraphs about who I am, what I like to do, and why I wanted to work with them. Reading back the old emails it seems such childish and poorly drafted emails and LinkedIn messages, yet three out of the nineteen Professors responded. Prof. Batra was one of only three Professors who responded to the mail and connected me with his Ph.D. student Rishiraj Adhikary, and then invited me to meet at IIT Gandhinagar. On my first meeting, Prof. Batra encouraged me so much and told me to continue my projects and also said that he would be happy to have me work with him during the summer. I am so grateful for this, had he not identified my potential and given me the opportunity early on my path could look very different."

But as they say, not everything is meant to work according to how you plan, and that’s exactly what happened, in 2020 came the coronavirus pandemic which disrupted my initial plans for the summer. It was not possible to be outside the home, and consequently, summer projects were also cancelled. Honestly at that point summer projects weren’t the priority either. But I still had a desire to work at IIT Gandhinagar, especially given that this was the only full-length summer break I would get before JEE I presumed. With the pandemic situation intensifying, I kind of forgot about working on a research project. But sometime during the summer unexpectedly, I got a message from Rishiraj bhaiya, that I would still be willing to work on a project remotely. While this was kind of unexpected given I had been dreaming to be at IIT Gandhinagar and work on a project in my fantasized view of a lab, I still was very excited to work on a project with them. This is how I ended up contributing my tiny bit of effort the Project Naqaab, where I designed a very simple led response to the ambient PM 2.5 levels, and retrofitted this setup onto a mask.\nAs I worked on this Project, my only expected outcome was experience, but to my surprise despite my almost insignificant contribution to the larger project, Prof. Batra, and PhD. Rishiraj included me as a co-author for the poster at UbiComp. Back then, I probably didn’t realize how generous it was of them to have me there and shows how people at Sustainability Lab value your contributions. In a world where people don’t give credit for significant contributions to academic research, as I look back to it, as a high-school intern, with minimal contributions got more credit for my work than I deserved.\nThis was my first experience working with the Sustainability Lab and Prof. Batra. After this, I also represented the project at the IRIS National Fair, but more or less this was like a good addition to my resume. Yet my desire to work at IIT in a proper research setting still remained unfulfilled."

Involving in these, I was motivated to pursue my extracurriculars more actively, and led me to apply to colleges in US. Prof. Batra actively supported me with the process and Letters of Recommendation, yet I met with rejections from all colleges I applied to. While this felt like a setback initially, it was an excuse to pursue my long-desired gap year. And this is where my journey circles back to Sustainability Lab, as I reached out to Prof. Batra if I could work with him, in my gap year once I finish my board exams."

    "text": "A typical day doing Real Research\nThis is after three years of first time interacting with Prof. Batra, as my friends were already planning to go to colleges, I was starting my gap year, with research working at Sustainability Lab IIT Gandhinagar. I was very excited as this was my first time staying by myself in a academic environment, and working on a full-fledged research environment. And definitely the experience, was very different and beyond my expectations. A typical day during that time was me waking up at around 7:30 am, finishing my chores and getting my breakfast, then going to lab around 9 am, and working on my targets for the week up till lunch, meeting new people at lunch and having sumptuous food, and then back at work up till dusk, then visiting other places around and playing foosball and air-hockey, having dinner, then playing volleyball, and back to conversations up till late night like 1 am and then going to sleep. And on a weekly basis preparing up a presentation with updates on the targets and progress on the Project.\nWhile this might sound very simple, unlike my expectation of the academic environment to be a monotonous one, it was much more spontaneous and fun especially because of such supportive around like Prof. Batra and PhD. Rishiraj, who always kept the environment an engaging one beyond just the work. I was not supervised on a daily basis if I came at a set time or not, what time did I leave, but rather was given a sense of autonomy where someday I could take a day off, and someday I would work all night. I never felt as if I was burnt out, and always was checked in by both of them if I was enjoying what I was doing, if I was eating food properly or not and so on. Spending 5 weeks, everyone around campus became like a family, not just at Sustainability Lab, but even the housekeeping staff, or people from other labs at IITGn. These memories and friendships are which I continue to cherish till day."

As I applied to colleges again in my Gap year, Prof. Batra assisted me with his full support, and owing to his support I made it into Harvey Mudd College, in Claremont, California. Before leaving to US, I went back to meet my friends and also Prof. Batra, and he also gifted me a book (Make Your Bed) with a personalized and touching message. But as I am now in College, the experiences I had back then, still continue to drive me and help in my journey here."

We used masks to monitor health-related parameters such as temperature and lung activity. In our Project the smart mask, Naqaab, measured forced vital capacity (FVC) of the lung using a retrofitted microphone, aiding in early diagnosis of upper-lung disorders. I myself focussed on implementing the feature in Naqaab that measures pollution exposure and indicates via different LED colours for eco feedback based on local pollution levels. Naqaab Presentation\nCO2 Monitor and SpiroMask: This Project was an extension of the Project Naqaabm where it focussed on using microphone to capture casual breathing patterns and calculate breathing rates along with forced breathing parameters. This project not only relied on audio based input to calculate the same, but also carbon dioxide sensors to get the data. This therefore also required as an additional component of measuring the Ambient carbon dioxide levels to offset the measurements, and also testing other hypotheses relating to carbon dioxide levels in public space. I specifically during my 5 weeks focused on developing this Ambient and portable Carbon Dioxide level data logger. SpiroMask Presentation CO2 data logger"

    "text": "Reflections:\nThe opportunity to work at an Institution like IIT Gandhinagar under the Guidance of Prof. Batra, offered numerous learnings both pertaining to research and just in general and wanted to share those below.\n\nThe first and foremost is definitely curiosity and pursuing moonshot ideas, was it not those I wouldn’t have got this opportunity in the first place. And more than approaching such amazing and supportive spaces like Sustainability, which are open to anyone who is enthusiastic to learn.\nSecondly is a rigorous and determined approach, definitely something I had to work a lot on especially coming from a background of exploration and not academic rigour I lacked this ability. But working on the research and with the advice that I got from both Prof. Batra, and PhD. Rishiraj, both always emphasized on the importance of pursuing perfection in the work we did, and not just making things work by chance.\nThen the next important lesson was documentation of one’s work, I heavily underrated its importance until I faced it the hard way, as working on projects, not only not having documentation hurts ones own progress, but also hampers other work. Most of the bottleneck in working on projects doing research I spent on figuring out how to navigate some errors which were not documented by other people. This underscores how important it is to document the work not just one’s milestones but also setbacks and errors, which is crucial for anyone to replicate the project in future.\nIn terms of a college/academic life, I also learnt the important role routine and discipline played, from eating food at right time, to doing your laundry, everything was important for a balanced and healthy time during the experience, and was a crucial skill that helps me till now.\nWhile it may seem contrary to the previous one, having spontaneity and engaging with new people around be it lab-mates or people from other labs, fostered some of the best conversations and friendship during my time. Be it a a random table on lunch, or someone at maker-space, or walking through the hallway, its these interactions that stay with us forever. This spontaneity is what enabled developing a human connection with people beyond professional or academic environment, not just as a professor or guide, but as a mentor, friend and well-wisher for life, who are always going to support and root for you in your journey.\n\nI am really grateful that I got such a transformative and life-changing opportunity to work with Sustainibility Lab, while it is definitely god’s grace and fate that I could get this experience, it is definitely to be highlighted that it wouldn’t be possible without supportive mentors like Prof. Batra and Rishiraj bhaiya, who gave space, opportunity and care to me in my journey. Definitely if you are reading this and considering to work at Sustainability lab, I can attest to the fact that the very least you would get is a bunch people who are there to support you in your journey in any way they can, it’s a space to not just grow academically or doing research but also a space to make friends and find lifelong mentors."

    "text": "ES 654: My Foray into Machine Learning\nMy journey into Machine Learning began with securing an internship at BEES Lab, IISc Bangalore, after my sophomore year. This experience plunged me into the thrilling world of Machine Learning. As a newcomer, I found the field daunting, filled with advanced concepts and rapidly evolving technologies. It was challenging to grasp the essence of Machine Learning and delve deeper. I pondered on differentiating myself from being just another coder proficient in CNN architectures using PyTorch to understanding fundamental concepts like the impact of a single LayerNorm block on model performance, the role of regularization in inducing generality, and the importance of visualizing the workings of the so-called “black box” of a neural network. The learning curve seemed colossal. Fortuitously, it was during this time that I was introduced to the course ES 654, an introduction to Machine Learning, taught by Prof. Nipun.\nFrom the very first class, where Prof. Nipun introduced us to the broad scope of AI, I knew this course would be a turning point in my career. His teaching approach made me realize the importance of understanding classical Machine Learning’s intuition, often overshadowed by implicit modeling in Neural Modelling Strategies. The course took us from implementing Decision Trees and various classical Machine Learning algorithms in pure Python to building neural networks from scratch. It illuminated the intuition behind optimization strategies and autograd workings. The structured learning helped solidify my foundation in Machine Learning. Particularly impactful were the on-paper tests, where we derived vectorized solutions to various problems, significantly boosting my confidence and understanding."

The best thing about Prof. Nipun was the way he streamlined the learning experience and crafted it individually for every single student. My initial task involved bug fixes in Pyro, a deep probabilistic programming library on Pytorch. This was my first foray into open-source ML contributions, and Prof. Nipun’s guidance was invaluable. I remember him hand-holding me in this task and giving me code suggestions before I made the commits. The best part was him celebrating with me on the small victory of the first PR getting merged! This marked the beginning of my deep dive into Bayesian Machine Learning, focusing on Gaussian Processes and Neural Kernel Networks, which became my primary areas of interest at SL."

Currently, I am a Senior Consultant at eClerx, where I specialise in Data Analytics and Engineering for a global investment bank.\nI had the privilege to work with Prof. Nipun as one of his first M.Tech students. This post narrates my enriching experience under his mentorship.\n Picture 1: (Dec 2022) returned to college for a late convocation.\n\n\nResearch Endeavours and Milestones\nThe M.Tech program consisted of 50% coursework and 50% research. My work with Prof. Nipun started in January 2019, broadly focusing on air quality estimation.\n• Experimention with portable air quality sensors (Jan 2019 - Apr 2019)\nI measured PM2.5 exposure among construction workers and calibrated five sensors to plot and analyse the data.\n Picture 2: (Feb 2019) calibrating Atmos air quality sensors at my workspace\n\n\nDeveloping a Live Air quality dashboard (May 2019 - Jul 2019)\nI deployed 5 air quality sensors across the campus and created a live dashboard using JavaScript, Python (Flask), and Leaflet.js. This project was crucial in identifying high pollution activities and their timings.\n\nPicture 3: (May 2019) Installing an air quality sensor at IIT Gn\n\nPicture 4: (Jun 2019) Live air quality measurements across 5 locations on campus\nI got introduced to interdisciplinary research - the goal was to calculate the exposure of PM2.5 in our college bus route. I worked in Tinkerer’s lab with a mechanical engineer to design a 3D printed mount using MDF, which was mounted in the moving bus:\n\n• Estimating ground air quality using satellite data (Aug 2019 - Dec 2019)\nAir quality sensors were expensive and provided less spatial coverage, we used satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological fields to estimate surface-level PM2.5 using a regression model.\nProf. Nipun encouraged me to write a short 1-page paper and submit it to CoDS-COMAD. I got my first short paper published [link] at ISB Hyderabad in January 2020. Fun fact: the presentation coincided with my birthday :)\n\nPicture 5: (Jan 2020) Presenting at CoDS-COMAD conference in ISB Hyderabad\n• Data Curation and Machine Learning (Jan 2020 - Jul 2020)\nGathered PM, AOD, and meteorological data for India through various sources and collated them in time and space. Used Ridge regression, random forest, time-series cross-validation for our analysis like seasonal variation in pollution. This study helped us in identifying the challenges for data curation and collocation for India.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the research, here are some links - [video][slides][pdf]\n\n\nBeyond Research\nThe learnings from Prof. Nipun that still resonate with me:\n\nDiscipline &gt; motivation\nPrioritise your health\nValuing the impact of work over accolades and recognition\n\nDuring my last semester in college, there was an abrupt change in our work due to lockdown and COVID. Prof. Nipun was supportive and understanding, guided me with my thesis and empathised during hard situations at home.\nProf. Nipun didn’t hand me solutions that cultivated a mindset of problem solving. This mindset helped me deal with different situations in my professional life too. I’d be forever grateful that I could have him as my thesis supervisor in college, and a lifelong mentor in life.\n\nPicture 6: A view from the terrace of my workspace, overlooking the Sabarmati river, was a constant reminder of how beautiful the campus is, and how privileged I was to be working there."

    "text": "About Me\nHi! I’m Shataxi Dubey.\nI had the privilege of working in the Sustainability Lab for one year and six months. Though it might seem like a short time, the experience was transformative. As someone who stepped into the lab with little knowledge of AI/ML, I was pushed beyond my limits in the best possible way. I realized that research is not just about writing papers or conducting experiments, it’s about developing the ability to think deeply, critically, and from multiple perspectives, that only comes with consistent effort and exposure.\n\n\nMy views\nWorking with Prof. Nipun Batra has left a lasting impression on me. I have never seen a professor so dedicated to his students. His discipline, punctuality, and openness were truly inspiring. Whether it was a technical doubt or guidance on a broader issue, all it took was a knock on his door to get a thoughtful response. His dedication to reviewing work, sometimes across multiple iterations and providing constructive feedback have deeply inspired me. I hope to internalize and embody these qualities myself.\nWhen I first spoke to Prof. Nipun before joining the lab, he asked about my proficiency in Numpy and Pandas. I admitted that although I had used them before, I was not quick at working on them. He shared that he still practices such skills regularly — two hours a week which speaks volumes about his commitment to continuous learning. Observing his perseverance and passion helped me understand why he is so well-regarded and deserving of every accolade.\n\n\n\nAt IIIT Delhi, captured the moment with all lab members at Wall of Honour with Prof. Nipun’s Photo on 6 July 2024\n\n\n\n\nMy best decision\nChoosing IIT Gandhinagar was a good decision, but joining the Sustainability Lab was the best one. The learning environment is unparalleled, and I feel incredibly fortunate to have met and worked alongside amazing people. I am especially grateful to my seniors — Zeel, Rishiraj, Rishabh, and Ayush for their constant support. I also had the pleasure of working with passionate lab mates - Vannsh, Devansh, and Nupoor. A special thanks to my senior Suraj for introducing the lab to me that motivated me to join the lab.\nIn this short span, I had the opportunity to contribute to an impactful project related to Brick Kilns. I am grateful to Prof. Nipun for trusting me with responsibilities that allowed me to grow. One of the highlights was having our poster accepted at ACM COMPASS 2024 at IIIT Delhi. Attending the conference gave me my first real taste of academic research culture: interacting with distinguished speakers, engaging in thought-provoking discussions, and experiencing the real-world impact of our work. The attention our work received from industry leaders and academicians made me realize that impactful research goes far beyond publications, it influences society.\n\n\nValues learnt\nI can confidently say that the Sustainability Lab is unlike any other. It teaches you that good progress comes in many forms from making a good pull request, giving a compelling lightning talk, delivering a solid presentation, or simply growing through daily discussions. There is always a new opportunity to learn and shine.\nTo be part of this lab, brilliance is not a prerequisite but a willingness to understand, implement, and persist certainly is. What I cherish most is that while most people measure success in terms of achievements, the Sustainability Lab values progress. More than failure and rejections, what matters the most is the growth that happens along the way. Because it is not overnight success that defines you, but the countless nights of efforts that lead to it.\n\n\n\nMy M.Tech Thesis defense on 2nd June 2025\n\n\nI wish Prof. Nipun good health and continued success. I truly believe that every student fortunate enough to work with him will grow, be inspired, and find their path. The best gift we can offer in return is our sincere effort and dedication. I still have numerous things to write but I will pause myself here and let the new comers experience what I shared !!"

I am currently working with Google DeepMind as a PreDoctoral Researcher. This page summarizes the 3 semesters I have worked with Sustainability Lab and how the experiences have completely changed my career trajectory and views about research!\nKeywords: Sustainability Lab, 11/10 Recommended, Real Flavour of Research, Best Mentor\n\nIntroduction\nIt would be an understatement to say that Sustainability Lab has completely changed the trajectory of my career. I had dreamt of being a Software Engineer from the age of 8. Computers were and are my Roman Empire, and younger me was always enticed by the idea of doing a job where I had to spend my entire day on a computer. How fascinating!\nComing to IIT Gandhinagar as a Chemical Engineering student, I always knew I would have to step the extra mile to achieve my goals. However, my journey was sweetened and streamlined by joining the Sustainability Lab and working under the guidance of Prof. Nipun Batra!\n\n\nNeural Network Newbie\nI joined the Sustainability Lab in my 6th semester. I remember the first time I visited Prof. Batra’s office, he asked me what I was interested in working on, and I naively mentioned that I wanted to build my own Neural Networks rather than using pre-trained models. Mind you, I had worked with two startups until then as a CV intern and an ML intern, but while I was able to ship code to production using fast.ai, play around with data, etc., I never had a core understanding of what Machine Learning really is. This is where the Sustainability Lab helped me.\n\n\nA class I did not sleep in\nI was also taking the coveted ES 654 course with Professor Batra at the time. I remember the first class of the course. Probably the only class in the entire duration of my BTech where I had a smile on my face throughout. Prof. Batra was showing us some videos on what AI is. I remember seeing a video of Amazon Go and being so fascinated and excited to finally learn a course because I wanted to and not because it was a graduation requirement. Simultaneously working with Sir in the lab, I remember, in the initial days, I took 3 weeks to correctly train a heteroskedastic MLP in Pytorch on a basic dataset. The catch was only to change the loss function, but my lack of understanding of core ML concepts led to me making numerous mistakes each time. What I really enjoyed during these three weeks was the fact that every time in the weekly meeting, Nipun Sir explained the loss function until I finally got it right. Then, I was extremely impatient, waiting every week to be given a “meatier” exercise rather than training a simple MLP. It is now that I realize how important this activity was for me. The latter half of the semester was smoother, and I was given a chance to play around with real-world data as well. That semester marked my first experience as a researcher as I also presented a poster at the UGRS.\n\n\nBrick by Brick\nIn my seventh semester, in the last few days of summer, Prof. Batra offered me the brick kilns project. This was the project that quite literally changed my career trajectory and defined my interests. The project aimed to use satellite data for the detection of brick kilns across India. The novelty lay in using techniques to minimize the data and maximize the metrics of the model. We were working on a rather challenging deadline of submitting a paper to a sub-track in AAAI’23 in a matter of 20 days. Every day, we had meetings in the office with Sir and we would spend hours in the AI lab, getting the code to work and receiving outcomes. This was my first experience writing a manuscript and also learning how to present one’s work. Mind you, I have always been into writing and reading fiction. I thought of academic writing as “boring and flavorless.” It was when the process of writing the manuscript started that I realized how important building a story is in a research paper. On 16 August 2023, at 1705 hours, we ended up submitting the manuscript. It did not matter that it was rejected. But those 20 days gave me the real flavor of research.\nWorking on a project that directly impacts numerous people, their livelihoods, and the climate fueled my intent to pursue a career in research. We continued working on the project throughout the semester. In my final semester, in a spur of the moment, I decided to take up extra credits and work on a project to develop a screening system for mental health issues in students. This was a project done in collaboration with another lab in the institute. Again, this turned out to be an interesting experience because we experimented with multiple techniques in the beginning and ended up pivoting our approach to make our results more explainable and ethical.\n\n\nThe Prof. Batra Effect\nWhat distinguishes the Sustainability Lab is Nipun Sir’s commitment to helping each and every student reach their full potential. As a Chemical Engineering student working in Computer Science and specifically in AI, I have more often than not had the feeling of not being good enough. Working with Prof. Batra has instilled a confidence in me that what matters is my work and not my branch. I owe my current position as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind to Prof. Batra for his invaluable guidance throughout. I remember running to him for interview help, preparation tips, how to write an SOP, tips on my personal website, and the LORs and personal notes. It was him who told me about the program at first and motivated me to apply for the same, not letting my doubts get the better of me. He always mentions, “Don’t self-reject.”\nI have always been an individual who focuses on getting results. My definition of results meant something positive and quantitative, a 5% boost in accuracy, or a reduction in loss. Anything less would annoy me and make me feel as if whatever I did in the week was futile. Mind you, Prof. Batra too is an individual who focuses on the results. But the primary difference here is his ideology about the result. For him, results mean the insights and conclusions that one draws from any task or activity. I have seen the transition in the way I now present my work. It is always introduced by the motivation and the “why.” Sometimes I don’t even have results, but I am more often than not content with what I am presenting. This ideological change was again part of the Sustainability Lab experience.\n\n\nLab Legends\nProf. Batra bid us all farewell with a book and a personalized note. Coincidentally, it is also my favorite book, “Deep Work” by Cal Newport (a book I have annotated heavily and try to apply at least 10% of it in my life). Nipun Sir’s sense of humor and jovial energy always made me look forward to the weekly meetings. I remember, when his office was moved to the new Academic Block, he sent us a video guide as to how one can reach his office. Another fond memory I have is him sending me the contact details of a doctor in Gandhinagar because he got to know that I had injured my hand playing squash. I have countless such anecdotes that show his genuine care and concern towards his students. My journey at SL would be incomplete without mentioning all the amazing colleagues who became friends: Suraj Jaiswal, Madhav Kanda, Dhruv Patel, Rishabh Mondal, Zeel B Patel, Aadesh Desai, Eshan Gujarathi, Saagar Parikh. The lab dinner at Akshardham (I will not spoil the reason as to why we go to Akshardham). Little celebrations we have at the lab and fun conversations that take place before every meeting have left a positive imprint on me.\nConsider this little article as my LOR to the Sustainability Lab to whomever it may concern 😊\nThis lab holds a very integral part of my BTech, and if you are an IITGn student who’s thinking about doing an internship/project with somebody, I would 11/10 recommend you to work at the Sustainability Lab."

    "text": "I am R Yeeshu Dhurandhar, an alumnus of IIT Gandhinagar. I graduated in 2024 with majors in Electrical Engineering and dual minors in CSE and AI. Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist at Skan.AI. This narrative shares my enriching journey with Prof. Nipun Batra and the Sustainability Lab, which transformed me and provided me with a deep understanding of ML.\n\n\nMy journey with Prof. Batra began in my sixth semester with the Machine Learning course. Prior to this, my exposure to ML was minimal, but I was eager to dive into this fascinating domain, and this course helped with this. Prof. Batra’s teaching style is incredibly engaging. He has a knack for using precise terminology and encourages students to think critically. Each slide in his lectures is crafted to prompt the next step of thinking, fostering an environment where students are continually engaged. I particularly cherished the after-class discussions, where we delved into thought-provoking questions with him. The assignments and projects in his courses were rigorous and immensely educational. They provided a solid foundation and deep understanding of the subject matter.\n\n\n\nIn my seventh semester, I enrolled in the Probabilistic Machine Learning course and a project course under Prof. Batra. Initially, I had little research experience and was new to the topic we were exploring. However, this project course proved to be an excellent starting point for beginners like me. We had initial discussions about the project and assigned some tasks for the next week. I remember that our team met two days before the actual meeting with sir. That was the time when I realized that research can not be done at the last moment. It requires time to internalize things. Post this learning, I distributed the work over the week and things went well. In those days, we used to have long discussions in his office, during which we tried to understand conformal prediction deeply. Those discussions gave multiple new ideas on different directions for the research and provided a true essence of how the research happens. Throughout the semester, we worked under him and eventually submitted a paper. Prof. Batra’s fairness in acknowledging contributions is exemplary. Unlike other institutions where professors might publish papers without student recognition, he ensures that credit is given based on actual contributions.\n\n\n\nAmong many reasons, one of the big reasons I have great respect for Professor Batra is his unwavering dedication to his students’ growth. He puts forth tremendous effort to support and guide us in our careers. During my MS application process, Prof. Batra helped me define timelines for writing SOPs and CVs and preparing for tests, which was crucial for meeting deadlines and maintaining quality. His proactive approach in reviewing SOPs and CVs, along with assisting in university selection, demonstrated his genuine motivation for our success. He also connected us with relevant alumni to further aid our applications.\n\n\n\nWhenever I have career-related doubts, Professor Batra is always the first person who comes to mind. This is the case even now, as I have graduated from college. After my internship at Skan.AI, I received a pre-placement offer while also considering pursuing a master’s degree abroad. Faced with the dilemma of accepting the PPO or requesting a letter of recommendation from my mentor, I turned to Professor Batra for advice. He recommended accepting the PPO, a decision that has proven to be excellent. I am extremely grateful for his guidance, which ultimately led me to my current role as a Data Scientist at Skan.AI.\n\n\n\nIn my eighth semester, I had the privilege of serving as a Teaching Assistant for the Machine Learning course. This experience was invaluable, as it allowed me to revisit the ML content, prepare industrial-level code, and experience the teaching field. What stood out most was Professor Batra’s immense trust in us, entrusting us with significant responsibilities that fostered a sense of importance and responsibility.\nDuring meetings with Professor Batra regarding TA work, we occasionally forgot small concepts we had studied the previous year. In these instances, he never made us feel uncomfortable and patiently explained the details. Moreover, Prof. Batra’s understanding and consideration during personal issues further highlighted his supportive nature. As a TA, I had the rare and rewarding opportunity to teach a class of 250 students. This experience allowed me to explore the teaching field and realize how challenging it is to keep a large class engaged for 1.5 hours. It deepened my respect for Professor Batra’s exceptional teaching abilities.\n\n\n\nProf. Batra’s influence extends beyond academics. He instilled in us the importance of respecting time, maintaining discipline, and adhering to what is right rather than what feels good. He made us learn the importance of honesty.\nIn conclusion, my journey with Prof. Nipun Batra and the Sustainability Lab has been transformative. His guidance, support, and teaching have not only shaped my academic and professional career but also enriched my personal growth."

Prof. Nipun and Zeel Patel patiently supported me throughout my project, especially when I could not make meaningful progress for quite some time, as happens in research. Zeel Bhaiya even spent a lot of his time explaining the implementation-level details of various papers to me.\nThis was a period where I learned a lot of fundamental concepts related to neural networks. These basic concepts have always continued to help me. We had weekly meetings to share updates and discuss new methods and approaches to tackle problems. Continuous interaction helped me stay on track and focus on the issue. Prof. Nipun always emphasizes the importance of consistency. I, too, understood the importance of this after realizing any progress in research only comes after quite a few experiments and most of those experiments may not give you the desired result. You can make progress only if you are consistent with your approach.\nThe experience also sparked a long-term interest in sustainable technologies and responsible AI.\nBeing part of a lab that pursued technical excellence and aligned research with real-world impact made me more mindful of the kind of work I want to do in the future. It instilled a belief that technology can solve pressing global challenges when thoughtfully applied. As researchers and engineers, we are responsible for building not just innovative systems but ethical and sustainable ones."

Over the next two months, my fellow summer interns and I successfully engineered a packaged solution. Soon, we also took the decision to publish a paper for the BuildSys conference regarding the same. It was my first experience with technical writing, I faced many challenges with the same. My initial draft was nowhere close to where it should be, it had incomplete explanations and other writing nuances. Prof. Nipun gave me pinpointed feedback and helped me get better at writing papers.\nAmidst the journey, life threw a curveball in the form of a severe stomach infection just two weeks prior to the paper submission deadline. Prof. Nipun not only empathized with my situation but also extended the gesture of taking me to a hospital in Ahmedabad. It led to realization that I had a mentor willing to go to great lengths to support me.\nOur efforts came to fruition, as the paper was accepted in the conference. The elation I felt upon acceptance was profound. This entire experience improved my technical abilities significantly."

Prof. Nipun presented a unique opportunity – explore edge computing methodologies in the context of NILM, and submit our findings to Buildsys.\nWith the deadline just six weeks away, time was of essence. Within two days, we outlined methodologies and devised an action plan. Collaborating with fellow ML enthusiasts from IITGN, we worked collectively on the submission . My honed technical skills since the past two years facilitated rapid implementation of chosen methodologies. Similarly, my technical writing skills also have improved with the previous experiences. Soon, we were able to submit an excellent initial draft. Two months later, we got the news that our submission got accepted. I felt a sense of accomplishment as we delivered quality work within the tight six-week time frame."

However, working with the lab acted as a compass, defining a clear long-term objective akin to choosing a performance metric to optimize for. Over the course of two years, I applied gradient descent in my efforts, taking numerous small steps toward the goal. The presence of an exceptional mentor, serving as an optimizer, ensured I stayed on the right path throughout the journey.\nThe sustainability lab has been instrumental in shaping who I am today. I’m forever thankful for the valuable experiences and insights gained under the guidance of Prof. Nipun."

With about four months before starting my master’s program and a keen interest in ML/AI, I approached Prof. Nipun to explore further. Here I started exploring probabilistic machine learning (PML) and doing some hands-on on open source. My first task involved contributing to the well-known PML library, Pyro. It took me three days to resolve an issue, which significantly enhanced my debugging skills. I believe that skills such as working with GitHub and understanding other people’s code quickly are crucial for both research and corporate environments. Prof. Nipun is one of those rare professors who also emphasizes these practical skills."

During this time, I was trying other things not related to this project, since I was not expecting any chance to work in this GSoC project officially since I did not have much background in ML, and also Zeel’s selection was almost final, so it was unlikely that Dr. Kevin take two students from the same lab. But Prof. Nipun pushed me to contribute to this project unofficially, saying, “You must give your 100% for this GSoC project; if nothing happens, at least you will get a chance to learn about PML and JAX.” So I started attending meetings with Dr. Kevin and Prof. Ashish Tendulkar (Google Research, Prof IITB) and started working on issues related to Dr. Kevin’s repo. Finally, the day came when Dr. Kevin told that - “we are happy to take Karm also as a GSoC contributor.” This opportunity would not have been possible without Professor Nipun’s encouragement.\n GSoC Team - could not find screenshots of our meetings so attaching this :)"

In between all this, many summer interns joined the lab for various projects. Initially, they were requested to make open-source contributions to Dr. Kevin’s repo and create pull requests. Prof. Nipun gave me the responsibility to review their PRs. Thus, I got a chance to interact with almost all the interns, and that was a great experience for me to explore my management & communication skills. That was the time when student space (in front of 4-5 prof’s cabin) was almost full with our lab students. Sometimes other lab students were irritated too, seeing that much crowd :) Prof. Nipun also started a very nice initiative called Code First ML, where in daily group meetings presenters have to explain one topic by implementing the relevant algorithms.\n Sustainability Lab at that time - pic before Prof. Nipun’s treat"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Paper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nLaTeXify figures\nUse our LaTeXify Python package to transform matplotlib figures into publication-ready plots. See our local guide for installation and examples. Key benefits:\n\nPrecise Figure Sizing: Automatic sizing relative to column width or page width - manual sizing within \\begin{figure} blocks is rarely needed\nFont Size Control: Sets font size relative to document text font size to ensure optimal readability\nLaTeX Font Matching: Converts fonts to LaTeX fonts so figures seamlessly match your document typography\n\n\nTip: You can find page width and column width with \\the\\textwidth and \\the\\columnwidth commands, respectively.\n\n\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences."

    "text": "TipStart with Our Research Skills Bootcamp\n\n\n\nNew to research? Begin your journey with our comprehensive Sustainability Research Bootcamp - a structured 10-day program covering research fundamentals, from literature reviews to technical writing. Perfect preparation before diving into the technical skills below.\nAccess the Bootcamp\n\n\n\nGit and GitHub\nThere are a ton of good resorces on Git and Github. I’m linking two such resources here: - YouTube video by Kevin Stratvert - Github skills\n\n\nPython Data Science Stack\n\nWe recommend students to study the Python for Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas. It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python\nRealPython has a nice tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming in Python. We recommend students to go through the tutorial. They also have a corresponding video page.\n\n\nLaTeX\nWe typically use LaTeX for writing reports and papers. We recommend students to use Overleaf for students to get started. Overleaf has a nice 30 minute tutorial that covers the basics of LaTeX. We highly recommend students to go through the tutorial.\n\n\nCreating a Website and Blog\nWe highly recommend students create a simple website and a blog. We have been happily using Quarto for our website and blog. You may see in action in Nipun’s website and corresponding GitHub repo here; and Nipun’s blog and corresponding Github repo here.\nBoth of these are built via Github actions. Feel free to reuse these for creating your own website and blog. We will be happy to help you get started."

We usually cover a variety of topics, including: - Short updates from each person on their progress - Discussion of any issues that have come up - Presentations on topics/tools of interest to the group - Paper discussions\nWe expect students to volunteer to present on topics of interest to them. We also expect students to volunteer to present on papers.\n\n\nProject Meetings\nThe project meetings are tied to specific projects. We typically start with discussing the last meeting’s action items, then discuss any issues that have come up, and then discuss the next steps. The lead student on the project is responsible for setting the agenda and running the meeting. The lead student is also responsible for taking notes and posting them on the project’s repository.\n\n\nIndividual Meetings\n\nRefer to https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-tips"
