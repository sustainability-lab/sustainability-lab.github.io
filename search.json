    "title": "From Chemical Engineer to AI Researcher - My Pathway Through Sustainability Lab",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nI am Aditi Agarwal, I have graduated IIT Gandhinagar as a Chemical Engineer with a Minors in Computer Science. I am currently working with Google DeepMind as a PreDoctoral Researcher. This page summarizes the 3 semesters I have worked with Sustainability Lab and how the experiences have completely changed my career trajectory and views about research!\nKeywords: Sustainability Lab, 11/10 Recommended, Real Flavour of Research, Best Mentor\nIntroduction\nIt would be an understatement to say that Sustainability Lab has completely changed the trajectory of my career. I had dreamt of being a Software Engineer from the age of 8. Computers were and are my Roman Empire, and younger me was always enticed by the idea of doing a job where I had to spend my entire day on a computer. How fascinating!\nComing to IIT Gandhinagar as a Chemical Engineering student, I always knew I would have to step the extra mile to achieve my goals. However, my journey was sweetened and streamlined by joining the Sustainability Lab and working under the guidance of Prof. Nipun Batra!\nNeural Network Newbie\nI joined the Sustainability Lab in my 6th semester. I remember the first time I visited Prof. Batra’s office, he asked me what I was interested in working on, and I naively mentioned that I wanted to build my own Neural Networks rather than using pre-trained models. Mind you, I had worked with two startups until then as a CV intern and an ML intern, but while I was able to ship code to production using fast.ai, play around with data, etc., I never had a core understanding of what Machine Learning really is. This is where the Sustainability Lab helped me.\nA class I did not sleep in\nI was also taking the coveted ES 654 course with Professor Batra at the time. I remember the first class of the course. Probably the only class in the entire duration of my BTech where I had a smile on my face throughout. Prof. Batra was showing us some videos on what AI is. I remember seeing a video of Amazon Go and being so fascinated and excited to finally learn a course because I wanted to and not because it was a graduation requirement. Simultaneously working with Sir in the lab, I remember, in the initial days, I took 3 weeks to correctly train a heteroskedastic MLP in Pytorch on a basic dataset. The catch was only to change the loss function, but my lack of understanding of core ML concepts led to me making numerous mistakes each time. What I really enjoyed during these three weeks was the fact that every time in the weekly meeting, Nipun Sir explained the loss function until I finally got it right. Then, I was extremely impatient, waiting every week to be given a “meatier” exercise rather than training a simple MLP. It is now that I realize how important this activity was for me. The latter half of the semester was smoother, and I was given a chance to play around with real-world data as well. That semester marked my first experience as a researcher as I also presented a poster at the UGRS.\nBrick by Brick\nIn my seventh semester, in the last few days of summer, Prof. Batra offered me the brick kilns project. This was the project that quite literally changed my career trajectory and defined my interests. The project aimed to use satellite data for the detection of brick kilns across India. The novelty lay in using techniques to minimize the data and maximize the metrics of the model. We were working on a rather challenging deadline of submitting a paper to a sub-track in AAAI’23 in a matter of 20 days. Every day, we had meetings in the office with Sir and we would spend hours in the AI lab, getting the code to work and receiving outcomes. This was my first experience writing a manuscript and also learning how to present one’s work. Mind you, I have always been into writing and reading fiction. I thought of academic writing as “boring and flavorless.” It was when the process of writing the manuscript started that I realized how important building a story is in a research paper. On 16 August 2023, at 1705 hours, we ended up submitting the manuscript. It did not matter that it was rejected. But those 20 days gave me the real flavor of research.\nWorking on a project that directly impacts numerous people, their livelihoods, and the climate fueled my intent to pursue a career in research. We continued working on the project throughout the semester. In my final semester, in a spur of the moment, I decided to take up extra credits and work on a project to develop a screening system for mental health issues in students. This was a project done in collaboration with another lab in the institute. Again, this turned out to be an interesting experience because we experimented with multiple techniques in the beginning and ended up pivoting our approach to make our results more explainable and ethical.\nThe Prof. Batra Effect\nWhat distinguishes the Sustainability Lab is Nipun Sir’s commitment to helping each and every student reach their full potential. As a Chemical Engineering student working in Computer Science and specifically in AI, I have more often than not had the feeling of not being good enough. Working with Prof. Batra has instilled a confidence in me that what matters is my work and not my branch. I owe my current position as a Pre-Doctoral Researcher at Google DeepMind to Prof. Batra for his invaluable guidance throughout. I remember running to him for interview help, preparation tips, how to write an SOP, tips on my personal website, and the LORs and personal notes. It was him who told me about the program at first and motivated me to apply for the same, not letting my doubts get the better of me. He always mentions, “Don’t self-reject.”\nI have always been an individual who focuses on getting results. My definition of results meant something positive and quantitative, a 5% boost in accuracy, or a reduction in loss. Anything less would annoy me and make me feel as if whatever I did in the week was futile. Mind you, Prof. Batra too is an individual who focuses on the results. But the primary difference here is his ideology about the result. For him, results mean the insights and conclusions that one draws from any task or activity. I have seen the transition in the way I now present my work. It is always introduced by the motivation and the “why.” Sometimes I don’t even have results, but I am more often than not content with what I am presenting. This ideological change was again part of the Sustainability Lab experience.\nLab Legends\nProf. Batra bid us all farewell with a book and a personalized note. Coincidentally, it is also my favorite book, “Deep Work” by Cal Newport (a book I have annotated heavily and try to apply at least 10% of it in my life). Nipun Sir’s sense of humor and jovial energy always made me look forward to the weekly meetings. I remember, when his office was moved to the new Academic Block, he sent us a video guide as to how one can reach his office. Another fond memory I have is him sending me the contact details of a doctor in Gandhinagar because he got to know that I had injured my hand playing squash. I have countless such anecdotes that show his genuine care and concern towards his students. My journey at SL would be incomplete without mentioning all the amazing colleagues who became friends: Suraj Jaiswal, Madhav Kanda, Dhruv Patel, Rishabh Mondal, Zeel Patel, Aadesh Desai, Eshan Gujarathi, Saagar Parikh. The lab dinner at Akshardham (I will not spoil the reason as to why we go to Akshardham). Little celebrations we have at the lab and fun conversations that take place before every meeting have left a positive imprint on me.\nConsider this little article as my LOR to the Sustainability Lab to whomever it may concern 😊\nThis lab holds a very integral part of my BTech, and if you are an IITGn student who’s thinking about doing an internship/project with somebody, I would 11/10 recommend you to work at the Sustainability Lab."

My thesis, “SpiroActive: Active Learning for Efficient Data Acquisition for Spirometry,” involved applying AL techniques to predict lung health across age groups. I also worked on ActiveNILM as a part of the Probabilistic Machine Learning course (hands-down one of the best courses at IITGN), apart from small projects in courses like Computational Neuroscience and Advanced Biomedical Signal Processing.\nPlease feel free to go through some of my work and reach out to me for discussions and new ideas 😃 \nSome of the highlights of my journey include   - Being a part of Google Research Week and IndoML 2023. - Being acknowledged by Prof.Kevin Murphy in his PML book. - Also being the first person in 2 years to be awarded the gold medal for outstanding research in the MTech batch, 2023.\nBut the cherry on this cake was getting a surprise celebration after my MTech defense 😊"

    "text": "Curiosity opens new doors\nThis story starts back in 2019, when I was a grade 10 student at Zydus School for Excellence, Ahmedabad. It had been a couple of years since I had been self-exploring electronics and IoT-related projects and participating in online forums like Element 14 community and making various projects. One of my projects was ThingFinder, which I got incubated at GUSEC as a student-startup, without even fully understanding what a startup meant. This was probably one of the pivotal points, as it opened a plethora of opportunities in front of me, being part of the startup network in Gujarat, not just limited to grants and startup network, but also support from facilities like Nasscom at IIT Gandhinagar.\nIt was one of the events by IBM at Nasscom, IITGn, that someone suggested to me given my curiosity to learn and work on projects, I should reach out to Professors at IIT Gandhinagar and potentially work with them to learn and grow further. This led me to then look up Professors at IIT Gandhinagar who worked on Projects on similar lines to my interest and cold-mailed them with long paragraphs about who I am, what I like to do, and why I wanted to work with them. Reading back the old emails it seems such childish and poorly drafted emails and LinkedIn messages, yet three out of the nineteen Professors responded. Prof. Batra was one of only three Professors who responded to the mail and connected me with his Ph.D. student Rishiraj Adhikary, and then invited me to meet at IIT Gandhinagar. On my first meeting, Prof. Batra encouraged me so much and told me to continue my projects and also said that he would be happy to have me work with him during the summer. I am so grateful for this, had he not identified my potential and given me the opportunity early on my path could look very different."

    "text": "Now comes uncertainty\nI was very excited about this opportunity over the summer to be able to work at IIT Gandhinagar, especially given the fact that me and my peers were all preparing for JEE at Allen, from class 9, therefore getting to work at IIT before even attempting JEE, was something I was mildly proud about. But as they say, not everything is meant to work according to how you plan, and that’s exactly what happened, in 2020 came the coronavirus pandemic which disrupted my initial plans for the summer. It was not possible to be outside the home, and consequently, summer projects were also cancelled. Honestly at that point summer projects weren’t the priority either. But I still had a desire to work at IIT Gandhinagar, especially given that this was the only full-length summer break I would get before JEE I presumed. With the pandemic situation intensifying, I kind of forgot about working on a research project. But sometime during the summer unexpectedly, I got a message from Rishiraj bhaiya, that I would still be willing to work on a project remotely. While this was kind of unexpected given I had been dreaming to be at IIT Gandhinagar and work on a project in my fantasized view of a lab, I still was very excited to work on a project with them. This is how I ended up contributing my tiny bit of effort the Project Naqaab, where I designed a very simple led response to the ambient PM 2.5 levels, and retrofitted this setup onto a mask.\nAs I worked on this Project, my only expected outcome was experience, but to my surprise despite my almost insignificant contribution to the larger project, Prof. Batra, and PhD. Rishiraj included me as a co-author for the poster at UbiComp. Back then, I probably didn’t realize how generous it was of them to have me there and shows how people at Sustainability Lab value your contributions. In a world where people don’t give credit for significant contributions to academic research, as I look back to it, as a high-school intern, with minimal contributions got more credit for my work than I deserved.\nThis was my first experience working with the Sustainability Lab and Prof. Batra. After this, I also represented the project at the IRIS National Fair, but more or less this was like a good addition to my resume. Yet my desire to work at IIT in a proper research setting still remained unfulfilled."

Involving in these, I was motivated to pursue my extracurriculars more actively, and led me to apply to colleges in US. Prof. Batra actively supported me with the process and Letters of Recommendation, yet I met with rejections from all colleges I applied to. While this felt like a setback initially, it was an excuse to pursue my long-desired gap year. And this is where my journey circles back to Sustainability Lab, as I reached out to Prof. Batra if I could work with him, in my gap year once I finish my board exams."

I was very excited as this was my first time staying by myself in a academic environment, and working on a full-fledged research environment. And definitely the experience, was very different and beyond my expectations. A typical day during that time was me waking up at around 7:30 am, finishing my chores and getting my breakfast, then going to lab around 9 am, and working on my targets for the week up till lunch, meeting new people at lunch and having sumptuous food, and then back at work up till dusk, then visiting other places around and playing foosball and air-hockey, having dinner, then playing volleyball, and back to conversations up till late night like 1 am and then going to sleep. And on a weekly basis preparing up a presentation with updates on the targets and progress on the Project.\nWhile this might sound very simple, unlike my expectation of the academic environment to be a monotonous one, it was much more spontaneous and fun especially because of such supportive around like Prof. Batra and PhD. Rishiraj, who always kept the environment an engaging one beyond just the work. I was not supervised on a daily basis if I came at a set time or not, what time did I leave, but rather was given a sense of autonomy where someday I could take a day off, and someday I would work all night. I never felt as if I was burnt out, and always was checked in by both of them if I was enjoying what I was doing, if I was eating food properly or not and so on. Spending 5 weeks, everyone around campus became like a family, not just at Sustainability Lab, but even the housekeeping staff, or people from other labs at IITGn. These memories and friendships are which I continue to cherish till day."

Naqaab Presentation\nCO2 Monitor and SpiroMask: This Project was an extension of the Project Naqaabm where it focussed on using microphone to capture casual breathing patterns and calculate breathing rates along with forced breathing parameters. This project not only relied on audio based input to calculate the same, but also carbon dioxide sensors to get the data. This therefore also required as an additional component of measuring the Ambient carbon dioxide levels to offset the measurements, and also testing other hypotheses relating to carbon dioxide levels in public space. I specifically during my 5 weeks focused on developing this Ambient and portable Carbon Dioxide level data logger. SpiroMask Presentation CO2 data logger"

    "text": "Reflections:\nThe opportunity to work at an Institution like IIT Gandhinagar under the Guidance of Prof. Batra, offered numerous learnings both pertaining to research and just in general and wanted to share those below.\n\nThe first and foremost is definitely curiosity and pursuing moonshot ideas, was it not those I wouldn’t have got this opportunity in the first place. And more than approaching such amazing and supportive spaces like Sustainability, which are open to anyone who is enthusiastic to learn.\nSecondly is a rigorous and determined approach, definitely something I had to work a lot on especially coming from a background of exploration and not academic rigour I lacked this ability. But working on the research and with the advice that I got from both Prof. Batra, and PhD. Rishiraj, both always emphasized on the importance of pursuing perfection in the work we did, and not just making things work by chance.\nThen the next important lesson was documentation of one’s work, I heavily underrated its importance until I faced it the hard way, as working on projects, not only not having documentation hurts ones own progress, but also hampers other work. Most of the bottleneck in working on projects doing research I spent on figuring out how to navigate some errors which were not documented by other people. This underscores how important it is to document the work not just one’s milestones but also setbacks and errors, which is crucial for anyone to replicate the project in future.\nIn terms of a college/academic life, I also learnt the important role routine and discipline played, from eating food at right time, to doing your laundry, everything was important for a balanced and healthy time during the experience, and was a crucial skill that helps me till now.\nWhile it may seem contrary to the previous one, having spontaneity and engaging with new people around be it lab-mates or people from other labs, fostered some of the best conversations and friendship during my time. Be it a a random table on lunch, or someone at maker-space, or walking through the hallway, its these interactions that stay with us forever. This spontaneity is what enabled developing a human connection with people beyond professional or academic environment, not just as a professor or guide, but as a mentor, friend and well-wisher for life, who are always going to support and root for you in your journey.\n\nI am really grateful that I got such a transformative and life-changing opportunity to work with Sustainibility Lab, while it is definitely god’s grace and fate that I could get this experience, it is definitely to be highlighted that it wouldn’t be possible without supportive mentors like Prof. Batra and Rishiraj bhaiya, who gave space, opportunity and care to me in my journey. Definitely if you are reading this and considering to work at Sustainability lab, I can attest to the fact that the very least you would get is a bunch people who are there to support you in your journey in any way they can, it’s a space to not just grow academically or doing research but also a space to make friends and find lifelong mentors."

    "text": "About me\nI am Souvik Roy, an alumnus of IIT Gandhinagar, where I completed my MTech in Computer Science and Engineering in 2020. Currently, I am a Senior Consultant at eClerx, where I specialise in Data Analytics and Engineering for a global investment bank.\nI had the privilege to work with Prof. Nipun as one of his first M.Tech students. This post narrates my enriching experience under his mentorship.\n Picture 1: (Dec 2022) returned to college for a late convocation.\n\n\nResearch Endeavours and Milestones\nThe M.Tech program consisted of 50% coursework and 50% research. My work with Prof. Nipun started in January 2019, broadly focusing on air quality estimation.\n• Experimention with portable air quality sensors (Jan 2019 - Apr 2019)\nI measured PM2.5 exposure among construction workers and calibrated five sensors to plot and analyse the data.\n Picture 2: (Feb 2019) calibrating Atmos air quality sensors at my workspace\n\n\nDeveloping a Live Air quality dashboard (May 2019 - Jul 2019)\nI deployed 5 air quality sensors across the campus and created a live dashboard using JavaScript, Python (Flask), and Leaflet.js. This project was crucial in identifying high pollution activities and their timings.\n\nPicture 3: (May 2019) Installing an air quality sensor at IIT Gn\n\nPicture 4: (Jun 2019) Live air quality measurements across 5 locations on campus\nI got introduced to interdisciplinary research - the goal was to calculate the exposure of PM2.5 in our college bus route. I worked in Tinkerer’s lab with a mechanical engineer to design a 3D printed mount using MDF, which was mounted in the moving bus:\n\n• Estimating ground air quality using satellite data (Aug 2019 - Dec 2019)\nAir quality sensors were expensive and provided less spatial coverage, we used satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and meteorological fields to estimate surface-level PM2.5 using a regression model.\nProf. Nipun encouraged me to write a short 1-page paper and submit it to CoDS-COMAD. I got my first short paper published [link] at ISB Hyderabad in January 2020. Fun fact: the presentation coincided with my birthday :)\n\nPicture 5: (Jan 2020) Presenting at CoDS-COMAD conference in ISB Hyderabad\n• Data Curation and Machine Learning (Jan 2020 - Jul 2020)\nGathered PM, AOD, and meteorological data for India through various sources and collated them in time and space. Used Ridge regression, random forest, time-series cross-validation for our analysis like seasonal variation in pollution. This study helped us in identifying the challenges for data curation and collocation for India.\nIf you are interested in learning more about the research, here are some links - [video][slides][pdf]\n\n\nBeyond Research\nThe learnings from Prof. Nipun that still resonate with me:\n\nDiscipline &gt; motivation\nPrioritise your health\nValuing the impact of work over accolades and recognition\n\nDuring my last semester in college, there was an abrupt change in our work due to lockdown and COVID. Prof. Nipun was supportive and understanding, guided me with my thesis and empathised during hard situations at home.\nProf. Nipun didn’t hand me solutions that cultivated a mindset of problem solving. This mindset helped me deal with different situations in my professional life too. I’d be forever grateful that I could have him as my thesis supervisor in college, and a lifelong mentor in life.\n\nPicture 6: A view from the terrace of my workspace, overlooking the Sabarmati river, was a constant reminder of how beautiful the campus is, and how privileged I was to be working there."

    "text": "Paper writing is a key part of research. This page contains some tips and tricks for writing papers. Paper writing is a skill that you will develop over time. But, it needs deliberate practice.\n\nPaper structure and Abstract\nI gave a talk (recording here, slides here) on how to write a paper. I recommend watching it. Other materials from the talk are available here.\n\n\nLaTeXify figures\nWe’d suggest using this latexification tool to make the matplotlib figures publication-ready. It helps in the following aspects:\n\nIt helps in setting the exact size of the figure relative to the column width or page width of the paper. After using this tool, manually setting the size within the \\begin{figure} block is rarely needed.\nWe can set the font size relative to the text font size in the paper to ensure fonts are not too small or too big.\nIt converts the fonts into latex fonts so that the fonts in the figures do not look different from the main text font.\n\n\nTip: You can find page width and column width with \\the\\textwidth and \\the\\columnwidth commands, respectively.\n\n\n\nSelf-contained figures and tables (and captions)\n\n\nTables\nWe follow this excellent small guide to making nice tables by Markus Püschel.\n\n\nComments in LaTeX\nWe typically create a macro corresponding to different author initials (I use \\nb for example) and then use that to create comments in the text. This is useful for commenting on the text, or for leaving notes to yourself. For example, I might write \\nb{I'm not sure about this sentence} and then I can search for all instances of \\nb to find all of my comments.\n\\newcommand{\\nb}[1]{{\\color{red}\\small \\iftoggle{hide}{}{\\textbf{Nipun's comment:} #1}}}\n\n\nActive v/s Passive Voice\n\n\nAmerican v/s British English\nThere are a few differences in spelling between American and British English. For example, the word “colour” in British English is spelled “color” in American English. The word “optimise” in British English is spelled “optimize” in American English. There are also some differences in grammar. I recommend picking one and sticking to it. Most of our previous papers have used British English (but often this depends on the set of co-authors).\n\n\nPaper timelines\n\n\nGrammarly and other AI tools\nI recommend students use Grammarly (or a similar) tool to check their writing once they have done a complete pass of editing. I do not recommend relying a lot on ChatGPT-like tools for writing papers as they can often lead to “correct” sounding but “incorrect” sentences.",

It is a free online book that covers the basics of Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn. It is a great resource for beginners and intermediate students alike.\nWe recommend students regularly hone their skills solving exercises such as 100 Numpy exercises. Given that much of our work is in Torch-like frameworks, the students would also benefit by attempting to solve the exercises using PyTorch.\n\n\n\nObject-Oriented Programming in Python\nRealPython has a nice tutorial on Object-Oriented Programming in Python. We recommend students to go through the tutorial. They also have a corresponding video page.\n\n\nLaTeX\nWe typically use LaTeX for writing reports and papers. We recommend students to use Overleaf for students to get started. Overleaf has a nice 30 minute tutorial that covers the basics of LaTeX. We highly recommend students to go through the tutorial.\n\n\nCreating a Website and Blog\nWe highly recommend students create a simple website and a blog. We have been happily using Quarto for our website and blog. You may see in action in Nipun’s website and corresponding GitHub repo here; and Nipun’s blog and corresponding Github repo here.\nBoth of these are built via Github actions.

This is part of the process. I expect my students to work hard, and I expect them to be resilient.\nConsistency: We do expect some seasonal variation in productivity. However, often the difference between a good and great project is the consistency of effort.\nStriving for excellence: Often, the difference between a good and great project (or paper) is the last 10% of effort. I try to push my students to go the extra mile, and I expect the same from myself. This goes in various aspects of work, including writing, coding, and data analysis. As an example, I remember doing ten rounds of feedback with an undergraduate student from the group on their presentation for a conference. It was a lot of work, but the student ended up getting offers (higher studies) after the talk; and the student was appreciated by the session chair - “It is hard to believe that you are an undergraduate student”.\nClear, honest communication I try to be as clear as possible in my communication, and I expect the same from my students. I also expect my students to be honest with me. If you are struggling with something, let me know. If you are not interested in a project, let me know. If you are not happy with something, let me know. I you are unable to meet a deadline, let me know. Lack of communication is counterproductive.\nI also typically want to help create a path for my students to achieve their goals. Thus, I expect my students to be clear about their goals, or be proactive in discussing their goals with me.\nCulture of respect and collaboration: I expect my students to be respectful to each other, and to other members of the community. I also expect my students to be collaborative. This means that they should be willing to help each other, and to help other members of the community.",

    "text": "ES 654: My Foray into Machine Learning\nMy journey into Machine Learning began with securing an internship at BEES Lab, IISc Bangalore, after my sophomore year. This experience plunged me into the thrilling world of Machine Learning. As a newcomer, I found the field daunting, filled with advanced concepts and rapidly evolving technologies. It was challenging to grasp the essence of Machine Learning and delve deeper. I pondered on differentiating myself from being just another coder proficient in CNN architectures using PyTorch to understanding fundamental concepts like the impact of a single LayerNorm block on model performance, the role of regularization in inducing generality, and the importance of visualizing the workings of the so-called “black box” of a neural network. The learning curve seemed colossal. Fortuitously, it was during this time that I was introduced to the course ES 654, an introduction to Machine Learning, taught by Prof. Nipun.\nFrom the very first class, where Prof. Nipun introduced us to the broad scope of AI, I knew this course would be a turning point in my career. His teaching approach made me realize the importance of understanding classical Machine Learning’s intuition, often overshadowed by implicit modeling in Neural Modelling Strategies. The course took us from implementing Decision Trees and various classical Machine Learning algorithms in pure Python to building neural networks from scratch. It illuminated the intuition behind optimization strategies and autograd workings. The structured learning helped solidify my foundation in Machine Learning. Particularly impactful were the on-paper tests, where we derived vectorized solutions to various problems, significantly boosting my confidence and understanding."

The best thing about Prof. Nipun was the way he streamlined the learning experience and crafted it individually for every single student. My initial task involved bug fixes in Pyro, a deep probabilistic programming library on Pytorch. This was my first foray into open-source ML contributions, and Prof. Nipun’s guidance was invaluable. I remember him hand-holding me in this task and giving me code suggestions before I made the commits. The best part was him celebrating with me on the small victory of the first PR getting merged! This marked the beginning of my deep dive into Bayesian Machine Learning, focusing on Gaussian Processes and Neural Kernel Networks, which became my primary areas of interest at SL."

Parallelly, I attended Prof. Nipun’s advanced course on Probabilistic Machine Learning, which complimented my research perfectly, enhancing my understanding of Gaussian Processes. The highlight of my time at SL were the weekly meetings with Prof. Nipun. His guidance extended beyond theoretical solutions to the nitty-gritty of implementation. His mentorship played a crucial role in my development, not just academically but also in how I approach problems in my current corporate research role at Skan. Our collaborative work, including contributions from fellow students Aadesh Desai and Zeel Patel, was recognized at the NeurIPS workshop on Gaussian Processes in 2023."

My first work was in the summer of 2021, where I worked on Neural network approaches for non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM). This work was accepted at ACM Buildsys 2021, and I presented virtually at the conference. During my final year, I worked on quantifying uncertainty in NILM, collaborating and mentoring summer interns (Vibhuti, Rohit, and Haikoo). This work was accepted at ACM Buildsys 2022, and I presented it at Boston. Besides this, I was a TA for the Machine Learning course (ES654) taught by Prof. Nipun Batra. I have taken two courses, Operating System and Machine Learning, with Prof. Nipun Batra. Having collaborated with Prof. Nipun Batra for almost three years, Sustainability Lab feels like a second home. So I have summed up a few learnings from my time at the lab which are even helping me during my graduate studies."

I got a low rank in the entire electrical batch, which made it impossible for me to get a research internship through college. Still, I was so firm that I used to mail professors and Ph.D. students in the US and try to find some opportunity. Through this process, I got one reply from a Ph.D. student at CMU explaining to me that I should focus on doing good work rather than finding an internship at a good place. After reading this, I joined the Sustainability lab for my summer internship with Prof. Nipun Batra. I first encountered Prof. Nipun Batra during an Operating System course in the fall of 2021. After this, I took a machine learning course in the spring of 2021. His teaching style is very intuitive, which sparked my interest in machine learning. My summer internship work got me a paper at an international conference, and due to this, I received my Ph.D. admission at UMass Amherst. Through this experience, I learned that rather than running behind the tags, if you work hard at what you like, it pays off well."

During my internship, I was never treated as a junior. Even as an Electrical Engineering student, Prof. Nipun Batra consistently showed confidence in me, assigning me an independent project. My ideas were valued equally, and I was treated on par with Ph.D. students. He involved me in industry meetings, providing insights beyond academia. In my last year, Prof. Batra gave me the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant and my first academic talk for the Machine Learning course. This experience significantly boosted my confidence. I even got an opportunity to guide interns in Summer 2022. With a collective effort, we submitted a full paper at Buildsys 2022, marking a successful collaboration. Most of my academic “first times”, like my first paper, first talk, and first research talk, have happened at the lab only because Nipun Sir has always shown great confidence in me, which motivated me to work. You will always get an opportunity at the Sustainability lab if you try to put some effort into learning."

I presented and recorded my presentation plenty of times, and he has patiently tried to improve my minute mistakes. We ultimately got positive reviews at the conference.

    "text": "Sometimes, the detours are the best part of the journey!\nIt was the third year of my undergrad, I was looking for a Foreign Academic Summer Internship in Machine Learning or Computer Vision. I was having a hard time finding an internship. It was the same time I had enrolled myself in Prof. Batra’s Machine Learning (ML) Course. Believe me, he is the best when it comes to teaching. It was the first time in my undergraduate studies when I felt like going to a class 😊. And it was his teachings that made me knock on the doors of the Sustainability Lab. I first met Prof. Batra and asked him if he could help me get an internship. I had no thoughts then on a summer internship under him, and the rest is history. I was very disappointed about not getting a foreign research internship, and even though he didn’t know me, he was all willing to help me out. I had finally found a mentor in him. From the very same semester, I started working with the Lab and then onwards there was no looking back. And now whenever I think about my BTech, this lab was a big part of it. \nI have worked on 4 different projects and some open-source contributions for one and a half years. When the entire world was going crazy behind deep neural networks, it was under him that I explored the probabilistic machine learning models. And got a whole new perspective on ML. My first-ever project was on Deep Gaussian Processes for Air Quality Inference, though this was a course project, it never felt that way. There was continuous guidance from him and his PhD Zeel Patel. Though we had limited time we were able to make significant contributions. We as undergrads (other collaborators Eshan Gujarathi, Saagar Parikh, and Sachin Yadav)  were able to publish our work as an extended abstract at ACM India, 6th Joint International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data CODS-COMAD 2023. I also had the privilege of presenting this work at the conference, and to our surprise, we were the only undergrads who had published their work. We recently got one citation, hurray my H-Index is now 1 😊."

    "text": "Deep Dive!\nBuilding on my knowledge of Gaussian Processes (GPs), I delved deeper into the nitty-gritty of its working. In my third-year summer internship, I had the opportunity to work on Batched Gaussian Processes. It was this solo research that gave me a lot of confidence in myself and though it was difficult to understand the math behind GPs, Prof. Batra and other labmates were always there to help me out. Prof. Batra is extremely reachable, you just have to ask him and he will instantly set up a meeting and will explain everything with great passion every time. I just used to wonder at times, how passionate a person can be. The thing about this lab is that you don’t feel like you are working for the first time, so welcoming is the atmosphere. I still cherish the AB6 Workspace where we as a lab used to spend the entire day, have fun, and help each other. His feedback during research meetings might feel harsh at times but yes that always motivated me to work to the best of my potential. One of the best parts of working with this Lab is that Prof. Batra knows what our future goals are and accordingly assigns projects to students considering his/her interests. I still remember that he knew I was applying for a master’s and he put me on an application-based project and pushed me to publish a paper in AAAI or NeurIPS. Until then I had never even dreamt of such a publication. \nAnd guess what I was successful in publishing my work on Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) using Bayesian deep learning strategies like Gaussian Processes in the NeurIPS workshop on Gaussian Processes in 2023 (collaborator: Gautam Vashishtha). A lot of credit goes to Prof. Batra and PhD Zeel. It was my experience of GPs from the summer that helped me quickly get going with this tough problem. And this work of mine has to be the highlight of my BTech. This work not only molded me into a good researcher but also taught me numerous life lessons. Prof. Batra’s dedication in academia as well as in day-to-day life always motivated me to do better each day. Every time I used to go with some updates on the work done, he would always point out even the minutest details, you might feel does it even matter. But believe me, it does, this makes you perfect at what you do, not only in research! I learned how to write good papers, and how to do productive research. “Drawing conclusions or insights is the key to any research problem” - were always the words of Prof. Nipun Batra!\nThis project had lots of ups and downs but he always pushed me whenever I felt low and felt like the project was not heading anywhere. But you have to trust Prof. Batra and follow his advice especially when you feel everything is going down the spiral. Prof. Batra’s words still echo in my ears, never run behind publications, and don’t think much about the end goal. Just focus on your current work, set smaller milestones, and keep producing results and you will never know when you will have a flurry of publications. Isn’t this relevant to anything you do in life, just focus on the present! My last work with this lab was on Multi Output models for air quality inference. Every new project feels like a new challenge but when you have an excellent mentor and support in the lab the job is half done. By the beginning of this project, I started enjoying research. To touch on another aspect, I had never realized the importance of open-source contributions unless I joined this Lab. The excellent environment at the lab of always helping ML society, helped me make contributions to Dr. Kevin Murphy’s (Google Researcher) Book."

Whether it be university selection, the application process, SoP, CV, or anything related he will always be there. I was just amazed by the way Prof. Batra reviewed my SOP and Resume word by word not only once but several times. I used to always get blunt feedback but that helped me prepare a strong application (studying today at one of the finest!). He always cares for his students, and even used to tell us to sleep well, focus on health, and then prioritize work. I have written more about the lessons I learned working with him, make sure you read that, if the above didn’t motivate you enough to join his lab."

On Lab outings, his “Delhi ka ladka” comes out and he is extremely jovial to talk with. The lab celebrations on paper publications or any achievements, Prof. Batra personally greeted us the very best during our farewell dinner and the Akshardham dinner visits will always be remembered! But the best part which makes me emotional every time I read is the personalized message in a book he gave each of his graduating students. And I have even carried that to the USA, that just makes me believe every time I feel low. \nFinally, I will always miss having fun and working with Vibhuti Bansal, Eshan Gujarathi, Gautam Vashishtha, Saagar Parikh, Hitarth Gandhi, Progyan Das, Hetvi Shastri, Palak Purohit, Harsh Patel, Shivam Sahini, Sachin Yadav, Karm Patel, Hrushti Naik, Shreyashi Singh, and PhD Zeel Patel. I always miss lab meetings and learning from him. Thank you, Prof. Batra, Zeel, and other members of the lab for the wonderful memories and learnings. My experience at this lab has prepared me for my future goals! And I am sure if anytime I feel like I need some advice, Prof. Batra will just be a call away!\n\nAadesh Desai\n\nFeel Free to contact me anytime."
